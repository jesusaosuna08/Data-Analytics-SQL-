Demonstrating data analytics skills through SQL queries. I am pasting my SQL queries that I run through BigQuery.


# Uploads and skills they show:
"RankWindowFunction" --> Use of rank window function using both the ORDER BY and PARTITION BY clause, aliasing, and sorting the results with ORDER BY

"WithClauseLeftJoin" --> Use WITH clause to make a temporary table where we pull data from two different tables, then we join it using a LEFT JOIN, and use WHERE clause to filter the data to only focus on one region

"CaseWhen" --> Using CASE WHEN statement to categorize values
